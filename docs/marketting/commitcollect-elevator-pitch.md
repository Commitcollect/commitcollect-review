# CommitCollect --- Elevator Pitch

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔥 Elevator Pitch (Short Version --- 20 seconds)

CommitCollect turns your Strava miles into physical achievements.

Connect your Strava.\
Set a goal.\
As you train, you unlock real 3D-printed statue parts --- piece by
piece.

It's not just tracking workouts.\
It's building something tangible from your effort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Slightly Expanded Version (Investor / Smart Friend)

CommitCollect is a Strava-connected platform that transforms athletic
progress into collectible physical rewards.

Users define milestones --- distance, elevation, or training targets ---
and as they train, they unlock sequential 3D-printed statue components.
Each workout contributes to a deterministic milestone engine that mints
permanent, non-revocable rewards.

You don't just complete a goal.

You build it.

## 🧠 Vision Version (Bigger Narrative)

Fitness apps track progress.

CommitCollect turns progress into artifacts.

By combining connected fitness data, deterministic milestone tracking,
and physical 3D-printed collectibles, CommitCollect bridges the gap
between digital achievement and real-world ownership.

Effort becomes structure.\
Discipline becomes something you can hold.
